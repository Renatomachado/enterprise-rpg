#Enterprise RPG

Originally this was a homework for a test and automation class in college. The idea of this little system is to evaluate your development team in a fun way using Acts, like a RPG game. This acts will be create by a team member telling something cool (Act of valor) or something bad (Act of shame) that another team member did (but you can talk about yourself), and the others members of the team will give their feedback to that act, and those feedbacks (evaluations) will sum or subtract your experience points that at some point, will make you level up or down. Higher the level, better member your are.

The focus of the homework was tests using Gherkin, so we user Cucumberjs, but now, the focus is on the aplication itself.
The tests will be maintained, of course.

This work started at gitlab with some friends, they gave their permission so I could put this here to train my code.
